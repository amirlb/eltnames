    <div id="explanation">
        <p>
            Reversed Semantle is a word-guessing game created by
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/yaron.racah" target="_blank">Yaron</a>
            and
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lightstep" target="_blank">Amir</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is similar to <a href="https://semantle.novalis.org/" target="_blank">Semantle</a> but in reverse:
            you pick a word, and the computer tries to guess it!
        </p>
        <p>
            Whenever the computer guesses a word, you score it for how close it was from 0 to 9, until
            it finds the right word.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the guess is correct, click on the ✔️ mark.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now think of a word and let's
